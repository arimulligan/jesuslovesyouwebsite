									<p>The Bible says, <blockquote>“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)</blockquote>
									He has a plan for you and your life.
									<br></br>
									Our problem is that we are separated from God by our sin.
									Being at peace with God is not automatic. Because of our sinful nature, we are all separated from Him.</p>

										For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.</blockquote>
									<blockquote>“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23, ESV)</blockquote>
									<p>God is holy, but we are human and don't measure up to His perfect standard. We are sinful, and

									<h3>But God has a solution that grants us a pardon from the death penalty — the cross. God's love bridges the gap of separation between you and Him.
									When Jesus Christ died on the cross and rose from the grave, He paid the penalty for your sins. The Bible says,
									<br/><br/><blockquote>“'He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness...'” (1 Peter 2:24).</blockquote>

							<h2>Come Follow Him</h2>
							<p>What is your response? — It's your choice.
								If you receive Christ, you cross the bridge into God's family when you accept Christ's free gift of salvation. The Bible says,
								<blockquote>“But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God” (John 1:12).</blockquote>
								To receive Christ, you need to do 4 things:</p>

								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-check"></span>
									<h3>Admit</h3>
									<p>that you're a sinner and understand that the penalty for sin is eternal death or eternal separation from God. (Sin is rejecting Jesus and disobeying Gods commands)</p>
